# ESC204-Lab3-IoT-Project
This a class project from the ESC204 course I am taking as a student at the University of Toronto. In this project we have developed an IoT system measuring the humidity/temperature as well as detecting motion on the arduino and transmitting these data to the io.adafruit.com website for it to be visible by our user. The performance of this project can be seen below.
